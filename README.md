# Better Fletching Tables (BFT)

Better Fletching Tables tries to improve the current fletching table that minecraft has, which does literally nothing.
This datapack adds the ability to craft arrows, tipped arrows and spectral arrows in a better way than the game actually does.
## Features

- Better way to craft arrows
- Better way to craft tipped arrows
- New way to craft spectral arrows
- Multiplayer compatibility
- Shift crafting

<h3>In more detail:</h3>
<details>
When you craft an arrow, instead of the usual 4 arrows you get, using the table you now get 6. When crafting tipped arrows keep in mind the following:
When using a normal potion you can craft up to 16 tipped arrows, using a splash potion instead you can craft up to 32 tipped arrows, and finally using a lingering potion you can craft up to 64 tipped arrows. Also keep in mind that the potion will be consumed entirely whether you did or didn't crafted the max amount that potion could craft.
Also, you can craft 1 spectral arrow using a normal arrow and a glowstone dust.
And lastly, when shift clicking to the result it will craft as much as it can with the items you gave it.

## FAQ

#### Q: Does it have multiplayer compatibility?

A: Yes it does.

#### Q: Can I modify the datapack and redistribute it?

A: Yes you can, but only say who the original creator is ([me](https://github.com/ElGeroIngles)) and if you link the original [Modrinth page](https://modrinth.com/datapack/bft) somewhere noticeable in the project.

#### Q: Are you going to make more datapacks?

A: I think I will, personally I do this as a hobby and only when I want and have the motivation to do it, and right now I don't really know what my next project will be, maybe I will return to another project, who knows.

#### Q: Why is the gui not showing? And why do I have a chest minecart in the head when I look to a fletching table?

A: Remember to also download the resourcepack to make it appear that it is not broken, go to "[Versions](https://modrinth.com/datapack/bft/versions)" > Click on the version you are using > Download the resourcepack.

#### Q: Does this datapack work on older versions?

A: Maybe, personally I haven't tested in older versions than 1.19 but I think it should work all the way down to 1.14. Just download the 1.19 version with the resourcepack and I think it should work, just change inside the pack.mcmeta of both the datapack and resourcepack the "[pack_format](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Pack_format)" value to the desired one (it may not work or at least not as intended).
